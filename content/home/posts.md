:page_facing_up: The Electoral Connection and the Representation of Geographical Interests. Evidence from the Post-War Italian Senate
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Most democracies define electoral constituencies geographically, that is by means of territorial boundaries. How do such arrangements influence the behaviour of national representatives? I argue that re-election incentives encourage legislators to deliver geographically oriented goods and services in a discretionary manner, something I refer to as territorial representation. To test this proposition, I exploit the unique variation in district representation generated by the voting system of the post-War Italian Senate. Instead of a fixed number of senators per district, the system in place between 1948 and 1992 allowed for variation within districts over time in the number of elected senators. I use this variation to test the hypothesis that districts connected to the elected senators receive more intergovernmental transfers, are targeted by more local bills, and feature more frequently in parliamentary debates and questions than unconnected districts. I further predict this effect to be moderated by the different strategies of government and opposition members. Accordingly, the increase in transfers and local legislation is stronger when the elected representative belongs to the governing coalition. By contrast, members of the opposition have a stronger impact on the amount of non-distributive activities targeting the district, namely local parliamentary questions, and speeches. Results will contribute to the literature on the electoral connection in multiple ways. On a theoretical level, I develop a unified framework for understanding a variety of geographically oriented efforts that are often analysed separately, such as constituency service, legislative particularism, and pork-barrelling. I also theorize and test heterogeneities in the effect of re-election incentives between government and opposition members that have been neglected in previous studies. Empirically, I get at the effects of re-election incentives using the natural variation in district representation created by the Italian voting system, thereby avoiding the standard comparison between politicians with and without term limits.

:page_facing_up: [Minority Status and Support for Supranational Integration](https://www.dropbox.com/s/liu0o5vbp2yf8wf/troncone_valli_minority_eu.pdf?dl=0) (with [Roberto Valli](https://www.robertovalli.com/))

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Are minority individuals particularly in favor of supranational integration? We argue that
domestic minorities are more favorable to supranational integration because they benefit
more from a strong supranational polity relative to majority individuals. Supranational
integration erodes the policy-making powers of nation-states, which tend to grant the highest
status and the most opportunities to the country’s titular nation. Hence we argue that
the EU constitutes a relatively more attractive political system to minority than majority
individuals. We test this largely overlooked intuition on the case of the European Union
using multiple rounds of the European and International Social Surveys. Our empirical
strategy relies on exact matching to identify suitable counterfactuals between minority and
majority individuals. Results indicate a positive effect of minority status – operationalized as
ethnic and linguistic traits, and parents’ origins – on support for European integration and,
conversely, a negative effect on support for euroskeptic parties. Moreover, we explore the
causal mechanisms and we find evidence that the effect is driven by individual assessments
of the state’s treatment of social groups. Altogether, our contribution demonstrates the
relevance of ethnic traits for supranational institutions’ support, and how one’s evaluation
of a political system depends on contextual judgments about ethnic biases.

:page_facing_up: Jumping Ship or on the Bandwagon? The Effect of Electoral Defeat on Party Preferences (with [Roberto Valli](https://www.robertovalli.com/)) 

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
How do partisan preferences develop in the aftermath of an election? Robust evidence suggest that electoral winners and losers display important differences in terms of satisfaction with and trust in the political system. By contrast, little is known about the effects of electoral outcomes on individuals’ preferences for political parties. In this paper we argue that elections can powerfully shake partisan attachments, with losers shying away from previously voted parties, and winners remaining safely attached to the bandwagon. We thus derive and test hypotheses both at the party’s and at the voter’s level. First, we predict winning (losing) parties to increase (decrease) support among the electorate in the aftermath of the election. Second, we predict winning (losing) voters to be less (more) likely to change party preference. To test these propositions, we leverage both monthly opinion polls for political parties across 12 European countries, and household panel surveys for Switzerland, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. Our analysis relies on a difference-in-differences estimator to study the impact of elections on party support, and on a within-individual estimator to look at the changes in voters’ partisan preferences before and after the election. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we contribute to the winner-loser gap literature by showing that winners and losers update their partisan preferences differently following an election. Second, we expand our understanding of opinion polls by showing how electoral results can dramatically affect patterns in voting intentions.
