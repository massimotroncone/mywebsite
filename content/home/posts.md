<div id="myDIV2" style="display: none;"><p>A It is often assumed that malapportionment biases policymaking toward the interests of overrepresented districts, but the literature lacks empirical evidence of such effect and its theoretical foundations. In this article, I first demonstrate that the two-tier elections to the Italian Senate between 1994-2001 caused malapportionment by allowing single-member districts with similar population size to elect either one or two senators. I then outline testable implications regarding the relationship between malapportionment, legislator effort, and the policymaking bias. Using a discontinuity design based on close elections, I find that the local interests of overrepresented districts receive disproportionately greater attention in bill sponsorship. The effect is driven by the election of a second senator and by the increased activism of electorally vulnerable senators from overrepresented districts. Both geographically-targeted and sectoral bills contribute to this bias. The results demonstrate the political consequences of unequal representation.

<div id="myDIV" style="display: none;"><p>The growing backlash against globalization raises new questions about the sources of public support for international organizations. This article proposes a novel theory of minority status and support for supranational integration. We argue that the gap in status and opportunities between majority and minority individuals affects the evaluation of international institutions. Individuals whose socioeconomic status and opportunities are restricted because of minority traits are more dissatisfied with national institutions and more favorable toward supranational integration than their majority counterparts. We test our theory on the European Union, the most advanced case of regional integration. Using different operationalizations of minority status and an exact matching strategy we demonstrate a robust positive association between minority status and support for supranational integration. We present suggestive evidence that minorities are less satisfied with the national government and democracy than majorities, and that discrimination or political exclusion moderate the opinion gap between majorities and minorities.

</p>
<p>
<button class="btn btn-outline-primary my-1 mr-1 btn-sm"  style="font-size:10px;height:21px;width:58px" onclick="myFunction3()">  Abstract
</button>

<div id="myDIV3" style="display: none;"><p>How do partisan preferences develop in the aftermath of an election? Robust evidence suggest that electoral winners and losers display important differences in terms of satisfaction with and trust in the political system. By contrast, little is known about the effects of electoral outcomes on individuals’ preferences for political parties. In this paper we argue that elections can powerfully shake partisan attachments, with losers shying away from previously voted parties, and winners remaining safely attached to the bandwagon. We thus derive and test hypotheses both at the party’s and at the voter’s level. First, we predict winning (losing) parties to increase (decrease) support among the electorate in the aftermath of the election. Second, we predict winning (losing) voters to be less (more) likely to change party preference. To test these propositions, we leverage both monthly opinion polls for political parties across 12 European countries, and household panel surveys for Switzerland, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. Our analysis relies on a difference-in-differences estimator to study the impact of elections on party support, and on a within-individual estimator to look at the changes in voters’ partisan preferences before and after the election. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we contribute to the winner-loser gap literature by showing that winners and losers update their partisan preferences differently following an election. Second, we expand our understanding of opinion polls by showing how electoral results can dramatically affect patterns in voting intentions.
