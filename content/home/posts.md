:page_facing_up: The Effects of Malapportionment on the Representation of District Interests: Evidence from Italy.
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
A normatively appealing characteristic of most representative democracies is that their electoral rules are designed to assure that each group of voters receives representation roughly proportionate to their number. Scholars have devoted a great deal of attention to malapportionment precisely because it is a violation of this principle. However, discerning the effects of malapportionment can be challenging because the intentional overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of some districts is almost always associated with characteristics of the districts that can confound the effects of the number of MPs they select. I take advantage of the two-tier elections to the Italian Senate between 1994–2001 and a comprehensive database of actions by individual MPs to disentangle the real benefits of being relatively overrepresented. Using a discontinuity design based on close elections, I first show that the Italian two-tier system caused malapportionment by allowing otherwise similar single-member districts to elect either one or two senators. I then find that districts that barely elect two representatives are more frequently the target of several legislative and non-legislative activities than districts that barely elect one representative.  The bias in favor of overrepresented areas is driven by the higher number of elected senators and not by variation in legislator effort. The results of the study demonstrate the political consequences of unequal representation and contribute to the debate about the design of electoral institutions.

:page_facing_up: Minority Status and Support for Supranational Integration (with [Roberto Valli](https://www.robertovalli.com/))
</br>
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
The growing backlash against globalization and supranational integration raises new questions
about the sources of public support for international organizations. In this article, we
draw on studies of nationalism and ethnic politics to argue that the gap in status and opportunities
between majority and minority individuals affects the evaluation of international
institutions. Our theory predicts that individuals bearing minority traits, whose socioeconomic
status and opportunities are oftentimes restricted because of such traits, are more
dissatisfied with national institutions and more favorable toward supranational integration
than their majority counterparts. To test our expectations we focus on the European Union
as the most advanced manifestation of regional integration beyond the nation-state. Using a
wide range of contemporary survey evidence, multiple outcomes, and different operationalizations
of minority status, we first demonstrate a robust positive association between minority
status and support for supranational integration. We then present suggestive evidence of the
causal mechanism implied by our theory. In particular, we show that second-generation migrants
and regional minorities are less satisfied with the national government and democracy
than majorities, and that negative experiences such as discrimination or political exclusion
affect minorities’ views of domestic and European institutions.

:page_facing_up: Jumping Ship or on the Bandwagon? The Effect of Electoral Defeat on Party Preferences (with [Roberto Valli](https://www.robertovalli.com/)) 

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
How do partisan preferences develop in the aftermath of an election? Robust evidence suggest that electoral winners and losers display important differences in terms of satisfaction with and trust in the political system. By contrast, little is known about the effects of electoral outcomes on individuals’ preferences for political parties. In this paper we argue that elections can powerfully shake partisan attachments, with losers shying away from previously voted parties, and winners remaining safely attached to the bandwagon. We thus derive and test hypotheses both at the party’s and at the voter’s level. First, we predict winning (losing) parties to increase (decrease) support among the electorate in the aftermath of the election. Second, we predict winning (losing) voters to be less (more) likely to change party preference. To test these propositions, we leverage both monthly opinion polls for political parties across 12 European countries, and household panel surveys for Switzerland, UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. Our analysis relies on a difference-in-differences estimator to study the impact of elections on party support, and on a within-individual estimator to look at the changes in voters’ partisan preferences before and after the election. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we contribute to the winner-loser gap literature by showing that winners and losers update their partisan preferences differently following an election. Second, we expand our understanding of opinion polls by showing how electoral results can dramatically affect patterns in voting intentions.
