I am a political scientist working on elections and political representation. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [ETH Zurich](https://eup.ethz.ch/).

My research lies at the intersection of distributive politics and electoral institutions. I study the distribution of public resources with a focus on legislative politics, clientelism and re-election incentives. I am also interested in public opinion and voting behavior, with particular attention to ethnic minorities. My work typically combines observational data with methods for causal inference.

I earned my PhD in Political Science at [ETH Zurich](https://eup.ethz.ch/) in August 2024 and was a visiting PhD student at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) in 2022.
