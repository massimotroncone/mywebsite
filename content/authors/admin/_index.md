I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [European Politics Research Group](https://eup.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. Between September 2022 and March 2023 I visited the [Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis](https://polisci.wustl.edu/). My primary research interest lies in electoral institutions and politicians’ behavior. In my dissertation, I take advantage of the two-tier elections to the Italian Senate to study the political consequences of malapportionment.

Currently, I am also collaborating on various projects on ethnic politics, with a particular focus on minorities’ political preferences and cultural integration.  My works typically combine observational data with standard methods for causal inference.

Before embarking on the PhD, I completed my MA in Comparative and International Studies at [ETH Zurich](https://macis.gess.ethz.ch/), and the BA in Political Science between the [University of Turin](https://www.didattica-cps.unito.it/do/home.pl) and the [Dresden University of Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/gsw/phil/powi). 

On this page, you can find information about my research and teaching. Feel free to [drop me an email](mailto::massimo.troncone@eup.gess.ethz.ch) for further requests.
