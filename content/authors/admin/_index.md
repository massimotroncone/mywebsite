I am a PhD candidate in political science at [ETH Zurich](https://macis.gess.ethz.ch/). 

My research focuses on distributive politics, electoral institutions, and voting behavior. I study how politicians choose to allocate public resources to secure re-election and how these decisions influence the political opinions of the general public. My work typically combines observational data with methods for causal inference
