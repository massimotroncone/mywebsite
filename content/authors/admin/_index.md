# Before embarking on the PhD, I completed my MA in Comparative and International Studies at [ETH Zurich #(https://macis.gess.ethz.ch/), and the BA in Political Science between the [University of Turin] #(https://www.didattica-cps.unito.it/do/home.pl) and the [Dresden University of Technology](https://tu- #dresden.de/gsw/phil/powi).

I am a PhD candidate in political science at the European Politics Research Group at [ETH Zurich](https://macis.gess.ethz.ch/). 

My primary research interest lies in electoral institutions and politicians’ behavior. In the first paper of my dissertation, I take advantage of the two-tier elections to the Italian Senate to study the political consequences of malapportionment. In the second paper, I exploit original data on church renovations across Italy between 1948 to 1994 to study the clientelistic relationship between the Christian Democrats and the Church.
Currently, I am also collaborating on various projects on ethnic politics, with a particular focus on minorities’ political preferences and cultural integration.  My works typically combine observational data with standard methods for causal inference.
